## History

In 2006, I did a lot of IT support and often had to diagnose SMTP connection issues. I got tired of 
manually connecting to SMTP servers using Telnet and entering commands one by one, so I created a 
utility to streamline the process. Eighteen years later, I'm still using it. I've now cleaned it up, 
added TLS support, and released it publicly. It's a simple tool with limited features, but it's 
incredibly useful for diagnosing SMTP issues at the protocol and connection levels.
